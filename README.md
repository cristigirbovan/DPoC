# 🛠️DPoC - Dynamic Proof of Collaboration (DPoC) Framework for Decentralized DeepFake Detection

## 🤖 What is this?
It's a **decentralized AI validation framework** that lets lightweight nodes (like your smartphone 📱) process real-world AI tasks (like detecting deepfakes 🕵️‍♂️), proving correctness with **ZK-SNARKs** (a fancy cryptographic trick 🔐), and securing results using **BLS signatures & Merkle trees** 🌳.

## 📜 What’s Inside?
- **📄 `DPoC4DF.pdf`** - explaining how this works.   
- **🚧 POC/POT COMING SOON!** - A fully functional Proof-of-Concept & Proof-of-Technology to showcase the idea.  
- **🔗 Blockchain Integration** - Because **trust** shouldn't require a middleman.  

## 🎯 The Idea
- 🤖 AI does its thing (deepfake detection, for example).  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Zero-Knowledge Proofs verify the AI didn’t cheat.  
- 🏛️ Blockchain stores the final proofs (not the heavy data).  
- 🎩 Supernodes play the **judges** in this decentralized AI courtroom.  

## 📢 Stay Tuned!
- **More code & demos dropping soon!**
- **Open-source collab? Let’s make it happen!**
- **Got ideas? PRs welcome!**
